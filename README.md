How to Increase the Suppressed Alert Threshold in xMatters

1Ô∏è‚É£ Log in to xMatters Admin Console

Make sure you have admin access.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Go to the Flood Control Settings

Navigate to the Messaging or Flood Control section (varies slightly by version).

If you‚Äôre in the xMatters classic interface, look for Flood Control under Company Settings.


3Ô∏è‚É£ Find the Rule for the Alert Group

Look for the rule that applies to your group: et-finex-bff-peak-it-EMAIL.


4Ô∏è‚É£ Adjust the Threshold

You‚Äôll see a setting like:
**‚ÄúLimit to X

Your Terraform code for GCP Monitoring and Alerting is quite comprehensive and covers:

‚úÖ Providers and Secrets
‚úÖ Log-based metrics (Kubernetes, Flink, XDS)
‚úÖ Notification channels (xMatters, Email)
‚úÖ Alert policies for:

Kube-system error logs

VM resource utilization (memory & CPU)

Cloud SQL memory & CPU

Flink job errors

XDS error logs

Notes for Improvements / Cleanup

‚úÖ Minor fixes needed:

In some resource definitions, there are small typos (e.g., <EOT instead of <<EOT or <<-EOT).

Double-check filter syntax for alert policies, e.g. metadata.system_lables.name should be metadata.system_labels.name.

Ensure alignment periods and thresholds are consistent with your alerting goals.

If you want, I can:

‚úÖ Review each resource block for syntax errors
‚úÖ Suggest splitting this into smaller modules for easier management
‚úÖ Create a .tfvars file for easier variable management

Let me know!
